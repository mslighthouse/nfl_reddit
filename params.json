{"name":"NFL and Reddit: The Superbowl Threads","tagline":"Scraping and Analysis of /r/NFL's SuperBowl (and Halftime) Threads","body":"# Welcome!\r\n\r\nThis is a project page dedicated to the analysis of [/r/nfl](https://www.reddit.com/r/nfl)'s Superbowl 50 Threads!\r\n\r\n# Methodology\r\nThe comments were scraped from Reddit on February 8th, 2016, two days after the Superbowl was complete. A scraper ([scraper.py](https://github.com/mslighthouse/nfl_reddit/blob/master/scraper.py)) written in Python downloaded every single comment, placin ghtem in an SQLite3 database. The information collected regarding comments were:\r\n\r\n* reddit username\r\n* nfl flair\r\n* actual comment\r\n* time posted\r\n* if gilded\r\n* net comment score\r\n\r\nFrom the database, the comment information was collected and parsed via a python analyzer script ([analyzer.py](https://github.com/mslighthouse/nfl_reddit/blob/master/analyzer.py)). Results were both printed out via the Terminal and formatted into an Excel spreadsheet. Though the spreadsheet is not in the repo, it can be replicated by downloading the repo and running the analyzer.\r\n\r\n# Results\r\nThe Super Bowl threads were massive compared to my previous project about the [college football national championship threads](https://mslighthouse.github.io/reddit_cfb).\r\n\r\n## Users and Posts\r\nIn all, there were 11,592 unique individuals contributing 73,860 comments. Of those 73,860 comments, 448 have been deleted.\r\n\r\n## Fan Representation\r\nLots of fans came with flairs shining\r\n\r\n<iframe width=\"900\" height=\"800\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\" src=\"https://plot.ly/~mslighthouse/24.embed\"></iframe>\r\n\r\nBut a significant number of users need to declare their flair (go Bills!).\r\n\r\n## Comments per Minute\r\n\r\nThere were some peaks and valleys in terms of people posting in the threads\r\n\r\n<iframe width=\"900\" height=\"800\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\" src=\"https://plot.ly/~mslighthouse/27.embed\"></iframe>\r\n\r\n(NOTE: I'M WORKING ON SYNCING THE SPIKES AND VALLEYS WITH ACTUAL IN GAME EVENTS.
